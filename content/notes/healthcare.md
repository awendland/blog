## Salient Observations

* General physician stats
    * Percent of physicians work in private practices: 54% (Kane, 2019)
        * Percent of physicians who are owners in a private practice: 41%
    * Number of physicians in practices of varying sizes: 35% in <5; 20% in 5-10; 13% in 11-24; 7% in 25-49; 15% in 50+; 9% in hospitals (Kane, 2019)
    * Physicians in USA: \~1m (Wikipedia)
* Self-insured plan stats
    * 61% of covered workers have a plan that is self-insured ([source: KFF 2019, section 10](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.kff.org/report-section/ehbs-2019-section-10-plan-funding/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1705382822069453&usg=AOvVaw3e5LnCjKugwH2bZaryeJu%5F)), with 71 million covered workers ([source: KFF 2019, design & methods](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.kff.org/report-section/ehbs-2019-survey-design-and-methods/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1705382822069671&usg=AOvVaw058kiXtnv1n4-ST-DetGBJ))
        * This was 54% in 2005, 44% in 1999 ([KFF 2005 exhibit 10.1](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.kff.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2005ehbs.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1705382822069950&usg=AOvVaw0v3fcKmY%5FodfUeYZVt%5FOpC)) and 40% in 1991 ([Sullivan, 1992](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.11.4.172&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1705382822070140&usg=AOvVaw1Mxohb3tbI5gHcwRQuPIXN)).
        * "Finance companies" have gone from 51% self-insured in 2005 to 70% in 2019 ([KFF 2005 exhibit 10.1](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.kff.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2005ehbs.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1705382822070392&usg=AOvVaw0tCTyVF86g8PmPj1VASoPO), [KFF 2019 exhibit 10.3](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.kff.org/report-section/ehbs-2019-section-10-plan-funding/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1705382822070587&usg=AOvVaw340TApdidXXaPF6ynca2aQ)).
        * For small firms (3-199 employees), this was 13% in 2005 ([exhibit 10.1](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.kff.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2005ehbs.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1705382822070857&usg=AOvVaw2WV1Za6ou8jH1P0wxMP2QH)) and 17% in 2019 ([exhibit 10.3](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.kff.org/report-section/ehbs-2019-section-10-plan-funding/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1705382822071078&usg=AOvVaw3lRNVEAeqp9WFhq9ziS1S7)).

## Ridiculous Observations

* Billed rates are frequently >5x the reimbursed cost ([analysis of Medicare PUF CY2018](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/AlexRWendland/status/1366569037677821953?s%3D20&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1705382822071520&usg=AOvVaw0TeRiqGjBxKjz59ht5TY3O))
* ‚ÄúThere are more than 9,000 billing codes for individual procedures and units of care. But there is not a single billing code for patient adherence or improvement, or for helping patients stay well.‚Äù (pg 150, The Innovator‚Äôs Prescription)
* The average annual turnover for members in health plans is 17%, ie., each patient is a member for roughly 5-years. This disincentivizes preventative care for issues that manifest outside a short (<5 year) timeframe. (pg 206, The Innovator‚Äôs Prescription)

## Questions

* What percentage of practices store credit card information for automated billing?
    * What percentage of practices charge coinsurance up-front, before the procedure?
* How much do claim clearinghouses charge?
* How are hospitals collecting data in order to accurately price services (for value-based reimbursement)?
* How are PCPs incentivized to be gatekeepers in HMOs/ACOs?
* How many self-insured employers directly employ physicians to handle care coordination (or non-physician care coordinators)? Why or why not? Do any TPAs offer this?
* Who is running Amazon‚Äôs healthcare initiatives? What complementary businesses do they need to exist (to create the value network) to provide their services?
* Review ‚ÄúCompetition in Health Care: It‚Äôs Evolution over the Past Decade‚Äù, Health Affairs (2005) - discusses capitation systems and the problem with it being an approach to value-based care
