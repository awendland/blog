Woohoo! Fun college things! One of those fun college things was
<a href="https://datamatch.hcs.harvard.edu">Datamatch</a>, a website started in 1994 at
Harvard where people fill out a questionaire and then are matched with their perfect soulmate
on Valentine's Day and given a free meal with them. I also worked with
<a href="https://www.harvardconsulting.org/">Harvard College Consulting Group</a>,
looking at user retention for a big 3 cable company, but it was severely lacking in romance.
