*This is from a note I wrote in 2017, there is likely a better way to do this in modern Docker.*

---

Inside the container run `sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 10.0.2.2`. This will add 10.0.2.2 as an alias for the loopback interface

Now, the container can talk to the host by targeting 10.0.2.2

Caveats:

* MySQL restricts user access by origin, therefore 10.0.2.2 must be added to the User entryâ€™s allowed origins
