* All endpoints initial provide a mock experience, allowing customers to begin integration before the entire backend is built out.

  * Responses have valid schemas. Why? So that customers can build response parsers.
  * Responses have values that are “realistic”. Why? So that customers can think through conditional logic handlers in their clients.
  * Responses are realistically sized. Why? So customers can think through performance implications.
  * All parameters are supported with realistic behavior.
