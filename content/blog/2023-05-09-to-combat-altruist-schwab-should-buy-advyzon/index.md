Summary

* Altruist presents a serious upset to Schwab & Fidelityâ€™s business model.
* Schwab/Fidelity don't have good all-in-one-platform acquisition targets to shore up their downmarket defense against Altruist.
* Most all-in-one platforms aren't suited for downmarket (where Altruist is acquiring it's power TODO rephrase)
* Their best defense against Altruist is acquiring Advyzon
