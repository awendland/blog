A﻿s of December 2022, I've got 34 houseplants in my 14' x 14' apartment in Manhattan. They take <3 hours of maintenance per month and provide a sense of freshness in a stark concrete city.

I﻿'ve learned 2 tricks for easy maintenance:

* **Watering trays** - K﻿eep plants in pots that drain into overflow trays. Water them consistently, ~1 per week, with as much water is needed to overflow into the tray.
* **Evergreen plants** - Don't bother picking plants that are impressive, pick plants that are consistently good-enough. A plant that doesn't lose any leaves or flowers and stays green all the time will look better than the orchid you forget to water for 3 weeks.

Besides these tricks, I've dealt with 3 challenges:

* **No sunlight** - M﻿y 2nd-floor room has a north-facing window and is surrounded by 10+ story buildings. I receive ~40 lux of sunlight at 1 pm. Even plants labeled "low light" still require substantial amounts of light to function, between 250 - 1,000 lux ([source](https://gardeningsolutions.ifas.ufl.edu/plants/houseplants/light-for-houseplants.html), 1 ftcd ≈ 11 lux). Compare those levels to [standard indoor spaces](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/light-level-rooms-d_708.html): break rooms are around 250 lux and supermarkets are around 750 lux. For comparison, an overcast day is 1,000 lux and full daylight is 10,000 lux.
* **L﻿imited space** - 
* **T﻿ravel** - 

C﻿atalog of species I have as of December 10th, 2022:

* 3﻿ snake plants
* 6﻿ monstera deliciosas
* 3﻿ pothos
* 4﻿ philodendrons
* 4﻿ angel hearts
* 1﻿ dracanae
* 2﻿ chinese dollars
