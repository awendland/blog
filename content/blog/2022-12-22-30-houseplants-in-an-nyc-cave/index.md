As of December 2022, I've got 34 houseplants[^1] in my 14' x 14' apartment in Manhattan. They take <3 hours of maintenance per month and provide a sense of freshness in a stark concrete city.

I've learned 2 tricks for easy maintenance:

* **Watering trays** - Keep plants in pots that drain into overflow trays. Water them consistently, ~1 per week, with as much water is needed to overflow into the tray.
* **Evergreen plants** - Don't bother picking plants that are impressive, pick plants that are consistently good-enough. A plant that doesn't lose any leaves or flowers and stays green all the time will look better than the orchid you forget to water for 3 weeks.

Besides these tricks, I've dealt with 3 challenges.

### Problem #1: No Sunlight

**Problem**: My 2nd-floor room has a north-facing window and is surrounded by 10+ story buildings. I receive ~40 lux of sunlight at 1 pm. Even plants labeled "low light" still require substantial amounts of light to function, between 250 - 1,000 lux ([source](https://gardeningsolutions.ifas.ufl.edu/plants/houseplants/light-for-houseplants.html), 1 ftcd â‰ˆ 11 lux). Compare those levels to [standard indoor spaces](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/light-level-rooms-d_708.html): break rooms are around 250 lux and supermarkets are around 750 lux. For comparison, an overcast day is 1,000 lux and full daylight is 10,000 lux.

**Solution**: Replace the 3 overhead bulbs, originally 800 lumens, with 4000 lumen, [high-CRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-CRI_LED_lighting) LED bulbs, and install 6 additional pendant lights. I chose [these](https://www.feit.com/product/4060-lumen-5000k-non-dimmable-led/) from Feit Electric since they fit standard A23 sockets, though they're ~2" taller than a normal bulb. They have a [CRI >80](https://www.feit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/OM300_850_LED_SpecSheet-2.pdf), which, even though [Color Rendition Index isn't as appropriate as Photosynthetically Active Radiation](https://mygardenandgreenhouse.com/lighting/understanding-cri-par-and-ppfd/), still indicates plant-appropriate, and natural looking, lighting. At 5000k, they look like daylight. Most places in my room receie >2000 lux, which makes my room feel more outdoors-like.

Directly under the bulbs can be too bright. See this leaf on a monstera deliciosa which sat ~4" under a pendant light for a few months. Notice the circular discoloration, matching the light's shade, and the browning on the leaf. I now keep plants >12" away from the lights.

### Problem #2: Limited Space

### Problem #3: Travel

**Problem**: I'll be away from NYC for >4 weeks at a time. My plants usually get watered every 1 or 2 weeks. When I was traveling for the holidays from December 18th, 2021 to January 28th, 2022, many plants suffered:
