title: My programming trends from 2020 to 2022

I﻿ use a program called Wakatime to track my IDE usage. In 2021, I was in the top 10% of all users. In 2022 I've decreased substantially, in line with my transition from software engineering to product management.

## I﻿ spent 120 hours actively using an IDE in 2022

I was p﻿leasantly surprised to see only 6 hours of software engineering work for Pinwheel. As I was transitioning into being a PM full-time, I h﻿ad two concerns: being unable to pull away from development work and staying too in-the-weeds with the engineering team. I've had qualitative feedback that I avoided the latter issue, and I'm happy about this quantitative data showing I've avoided the former! This was ~1/100th of the time I spent programming for Pinwheel in 2021. Instead, I spent hundreds of hours[^1] using writing and data analysis tools (Notion, Jupyter notebooks, Google Sheets, Looker, and various SQL runners).

T﻿he remaining ~100 hours were between consulting work for Luminopia and friends' startups, and hobby projects. I've been working on improving my productivity, so I was glad to see my hobby project work in <3 hour bursts. >70% of the bursts corresponded with discrete functionality being added[^2].

[^1]: In addition to Wakatime I use Rescuetime. Wakatime tracks IDE usage, which repo you're working on, and the languages of the files you're editing. Rescuetime tracks which desktop apps and websites you're actively using.

[﻿^2]: Based on a quick review of the past 2 months. I coded on 26 days, grossing an average of 1.5 hours per day.
