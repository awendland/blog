More than once I've come across a situation where I've needed to download a set of files from a website, all on the same page, and all with a similar HTML markup pattern. Additionally, I've come to fall in love with the Linux Terminal and all of its easy-to-use commands. So, here's a mashup of the two!<!--break-->

I wanted to download all the (free, legal) mp3s from [www.itsmetrognome.com/music/](metrognome). Fortunately, they download links all followed the same general style:

```html
<a
  class="btn_left  has-counter"
  rel="36"
  title="iPhone (MetroGnome Remix)"
  href="http://www.itsmetrognome.com/?wpdmact=process&did=MzYuaG90bGluaw=="
  >Download</a
>
```

Therefore it was relatively easy to come up with a regex pattern that would match them:

```perl
href='(.+?)'.*?>Download
```

This had to be adapted slightly for the final version to use lookaheads and the like because `grep` cannopt pipe individual regex groups (as far as I am aware). Additionally, `xargs` was used to send the grepped urls to `wget`. The `--content-disposition` paramater on `wget` caused the downloaded files to have their normal, human-readable names.

Here's the final one line command script that will download all of MetroGnome's music for you!

```bash
curl -s www.itsmetrognome.com/music/ | grep -Po "(?<=href=')(.+?)(?='.*?>Download)" | xargs -P16 wget --content-disposition
```
