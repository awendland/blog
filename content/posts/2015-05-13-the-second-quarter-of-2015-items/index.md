I was inspired by a website I stumbled across on called [My Faults My Own by Ross Rheingans-Yoo](http://blog.rossry.net/reading/) in which he keeps a live post for each month where he lists worthwhile articles he's read and other things he _"would like to signal-boost, but won't take the time to do full writeups on"_. I enjoy the idea substantially, and with this post am commencing along the path he blazed.

**Book:** ★★★★★ [Altered Carbon - Richard K. Morgan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40445.Altered_Carbon)

> It's the twenty-fifth century, and advances in technology have redefined life itself. A person's consciousness can now be stored in the brain and downloaded into a new body [or "sleeve"], making death nothing more than a minor blip on a screen.

**Book:** ★★★★★ [Pride and Prejudice - Jane Austen](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1885.Pride_and_Prejudice)

> Jane Austen's witty comedy of manners--one of the most popular novels of all time--that features splendidly civilized sparring between the proud Mr. Darcy and the prejudiced Elizabeth Bennet as they play out their spirited courtship in a series of eighteenth-century drawing-room intrigues.

**Book:** ★★★★☆ [Consider Phlebas (Culture #1) - Iain M. Banks](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8935689-consider-phlebas)

> The war raged across the galaxy. Billions had died, billions more were doomed. Moons, planets, the very stars themselves, faced destruction, cold-blooded, brutal, and worse, random. The Idirans fought for their Faith; the Culture for its moral right to exist.

**Book:** ★★★★☆ [The Player of Games (Culture #2) - Iain M. Banks](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18630.The_Player_of_Games)

> In the ancient, all-embracing Culture in which there is no disease or disaster, only the endless games, he has beaten them all. But an empire's challenge will teach him what the Game is really all about.

**Book:** ★★★★☆ [Use of Weapons (Culture #3) - Iain M. Banks](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12007.Use_of_Weapons)

> Cheradenine is an ex-special circumstance agent who had been raised to eminence by a woman named Diziet. Skaffen-Amtskaw, the drone, had saved her life and it believes Cheradenine to be a burnt-out case. But not even its machine intelligence can see the horrors in his past.

### Current Events

**Article:** [Wired - What Schools Must Learn From LA’s iPad Debacle](http://www.wired.com/2015/05/los-angeles-edtech/)

> “LA is emblematic of a problem we’re seeing across the country right now,” he says. “Districts are starting with the technology and not asking themselves: ‘What problem are we trying to solve, and what’s the instructional model we need to solve it?’ and then finding technology in service of that.”

### Science!

**Webpage:** [GRACE Tellus - Jet Propulsion Laboratory](http://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/)

> This is a fascinating project that uses two satellites orbiting Earth to calculate soil change through minute gravity differences by precisely measuring the distance between the two satellites. Here is additional [PBS NOVA Coverage](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/earth/space-weighing-groundwater-lost-irrigation/).

### Friends' Writeups

**Feature:** [Senioritis: Why I’m too lazy to think of a better title - Krista Schildwachter](http://highschool.latimes.com/corona-del-mar-high-school/senioritis-why-im-too-lazy-to-think-of-a-better-title/)

> The generation above us seems to think that senioritis is the cause of an inherently lazy youth, and if maybe we did not utilize technology as a procrastination tool, we would learn a better sense of responsibility.

**Feature:** [To wear or not to wear? - Delaney Ivey](http://highschool.latimes.com/corona-del-mar-high-school/to-wear-or-not-to-wear/)

> Complying with the dress code seems like a simple fix. But when there are no knee-length shorts available in the women’s department and girls who wear boys shorts are subject to teasing, it becomes a lose-lose situation.

### Funny
