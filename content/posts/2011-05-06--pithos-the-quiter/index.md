**Pithos**, a Linux app the streams **Pandora Radio** natively without the clunky flash webapp or any sort of browser being open, would consistantly crash after a few songs and would have to be restarted to continue playing. I found a fix on this website: [Pithos Launchpad](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pithos/+bug/705271). The fix requires creating a file with the name **_pithos.patch_** and then putting this text inside (Updated with a link to the file. Wordpress wouldn't display the code right. You can retrieve it using **wget https://launchpadlibrarian.net/70116767/pithos.patch)**:

That succesfully fixed my **Pithos** installation to continuesly play the music without stopping. **Pithos** rocks now!
