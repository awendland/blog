Following a guide on [Ubuntu Forums](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=702372), I set up a program called **BlueProximity** that detects the distance my phone is away and when my phone reaches a certain distance, locks my computer. When my phone gets close enough, it unlock it again! That's really cool :). I have it set up so when I walk out of the room my computer locks and when I walk back in it unlocks. How convenient!
