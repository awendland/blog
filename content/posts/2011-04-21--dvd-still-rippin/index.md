I've been trying to find the easiest solution for ripping DVDs to a format stream-able to my Droid X but currently stuck using a three step process. First I have to rip the DVDs in Windows on my main computer using **1Click DVD Copy**. This outputs a **Video_TS** folder structure. I then copy the **Video_TS** folder and its parent folder onto my external hard-drive attached to my server. There I begin the encoding process with **Handbrake** which encodes it into a **mp4** file ~2.5gb big. After this I use **Super** to encode it again into a smaller, stream-able **mp4** file that looks good and can stream to my phone over **DLNA**.
