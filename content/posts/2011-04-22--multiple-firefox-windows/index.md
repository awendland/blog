I have found myself wanting to work with multiple Firefox windows open because of my dual monitor setup. When closing Firefox through conventional means though, it wouldn't save one of the windows. Fortunately, I have found a solution: by closing Firefox from **File > Quit** or by using **Control Q.** When I reopen Firefox both windows open with all my tabs!
