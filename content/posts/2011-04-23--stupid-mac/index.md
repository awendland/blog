After successfully installing Mac OSX 10.6.6 on my brother's Sony VAIO, my dad needed the hard-drive **expanded** to install XCODE for Iphone dev. First, I tried shrinking the **Windows partition** and merging it into the **Mac partition**. I could shrink the Windows partition but unfortunatly couldn't merge it with the Mac one. I tried to create a new partition from the empty space in Ubuntu but it said it couldn't because **4 was the max unless it was an extended partition** :(. I then decided to delete the Ubuntu partition from windows and format it to **fat32, a universal filesystem**. Mac would be able to see it but, afterÂ  trying to boot back up, grub rescue> came up. Duh! Grub **was installed with Ubuntu**! It worked and I finally installed XCODE after I booted up from my USB Ubuntu Live CD and **reinstalled GRUB** with these instructions:

> **Reinstalling GRUB 2 from LiveCD** If you cannot boot from GRUB 2 and need to reinstall it, here is the simple method. For more details or for advanced options, refer to the Ubuntu community documentation here: [Grub2 - Reinstalling GRUB 2](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Reinstalling%20GRUB%202):
>
> - Boot the Ubuntu Live CD (Try without installing).
> - From the Desktop, open a terminal - Applications, Accessories, Terminal.
> - Determine your normal system partition - `sudo fdisk -l` (That is a lowercase L)
> - If you aren't sure, run `df -Th`. Look for the correct disk size and ext3 or ext4 format.
> - Mount your normal system partition:
>
>   ```
>   sudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt
>   ```
>
>   - If you aren't sure if you mounted the correct partition, once it's mounted run "nautilus /mnt" to inspect the partition. If it is the correct partition, you should see the normal Ubuntu folders such as /bin, /boot, /etc, /home, etc
>   - Example: sudo mount /dev/sda1/mnt
>   - Note: The partition to mount is normally the partition on which Ubuntu was installed: sda1, sdb5, etc. If you have a separate /boot partition, use the device on which the /boot partition is located. Grub 2 works best when installed in the MBR of the drive to which BIOS boots. Also remember that you _mount_ the partition (including the number) in this step, but you do _not_ include the partition number when you run the "sudo grub-install" command later.
>   - Note: GRUB 2 counts the first drive (X) as "0", but the first partition (Y) as "1"
>
> - Only if you have a separate boot partition:
>   ```
>   sudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt/boot
>   ```
>   with sdXY being your /boot partition designation.
> - Reinstall GRUB 2:
>   ```
>   sudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sdX
>   ```
>   Do NOT include the partition number.
>   - Example: sudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sd*a*
>   - Note: Substitute the device on which Ubuntu was installed - sda, sdb, etc. Do _not_ specify a partition number.
> - Unmount the partition:
>
>   ```
>   sudo umount /mnt
>   ```
>
>   - Note: If you mounted a separate /boot partition, unmount it first:
>     ```
>     sudo umount /mnt/boot
>     ```
>
> - Reboot.
