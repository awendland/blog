Testing out WebAssembly features that are only present in [webassembly/spec](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/tree/master/interpreter)'s reference interpreter is hard because the interpreter is written in OCaml and can't be run on the web.

So I created a Jupyter kernel that interfaces with its REPL. Now you can showcase WebAssembly code in a Jupyter environment.

Find the package on PyPi: [![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/wasm-spec-kernel?label=latest%20%40%20pypi)](https://pypi.org/project/wasm-spec-kernel/)

Explore the source code on GitHub: [![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/awendland/wasm_spec_kernel?label=recent%20commit%20%40%20github)](https://github.com/awendland/wasm_spec_kernel)

Also, you can jump right into a web-based Jupyter notebook with this kernel loaded thanks to Binder: [![launch Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/awendland/wasm_spec_kernel/HEAD?filepath=example_notebook.ipynb)
