I'm so siked, I have fixed two XBOXs that have faced RROD (Red-Ring-of-Death) using these instructions. Both people had already bought new XBOXs, so I got to keep the fixed, and now working totally fine, old XBOXs. I started off by following this [guide](http://www.instructables.com/id/Fix-the-Red-Ring-of-Deathwithout-towels/) on Instructables.com and using the parts list there:

    ===================
    4 5x20MM Panhead Machine Screws (Keep length between 20 and 40 MM)
    4 5x15MM Panhead Machine Screw (Must be no longer than 15MM!)
    44 #10 Washers
    ===================

    And for your English measurements (Thanks to ajmontag for providing these):

    ***********************
    4 3/16" x 1" Panhead Machine Screws
    4 3/16" x 1/2" Panhead Machine Screws
    44 #10 Washers
    ***********************

Then I followed a guide from <http://www.llamma.com/xbox360/repair/ring_of_light_x-clamp_fix.htm> to actually do the fix:

I followed these guides almost exactly, until I got to the order you stack the washers. The washers I bought from ACE Hardware wouldn't work in the order provided by those guides, but I found out an order that works perfectly.

    Steel washer is --- , Nylon washer is === , and the motherboard is MMM

Everything else I followed exactly in the Llama Guide. One more thing, I can't emphasize enough how important the overheating step is. Overheating the GPU has sometimes fixed a RROD XBOX for me without having to do the rest of the fix(it won't hurt though to do them if you don't want the problem to come back). I also found that overheating the GPU can fix any screen freeze problems you have :) Up next....how to fix a YLOD Playstation 3!
