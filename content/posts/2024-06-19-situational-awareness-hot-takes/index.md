1. Situational Awareness is submarine marketing so Ilya can raise a fat round for [SSI](https://ssi.inc/).

2. Situational Awareness overstates algorithmic improvements because [benchmarks are in the training data](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.11020v1) and [models can't operate on out-of-distribution questions](https://arxiv.org/html/2405.15071v2).

3. Situational Awareness overstates future algorithmic progress because [transformers have no world models](https://x.com/keyonV/status/1803838591371555252) and breakthroughs are in [inference optimizations](https://research.character.ai/optimizing-inference/) rather than [core architecture](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/190q1vb/comment/kgrhtsk/).

4. Situational Awareness is a Cassandra.
