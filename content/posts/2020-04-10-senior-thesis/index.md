I submitted my undergraduate thesis for Honors in Computer Science at Harvard on "WebAssembly as a Multi-Language Platform". My advisor was Professor [Nada Amin](https://lampwww.epfl.ch/~amin/cv/), and my readers were [James Mickens](https://mickens.seas.harvard.edu/), [Stephen Chong](https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~chong/), and [Eddie Kohler](http://www.read.seas.harvard.edu/~kohler/).

Where to find it:
